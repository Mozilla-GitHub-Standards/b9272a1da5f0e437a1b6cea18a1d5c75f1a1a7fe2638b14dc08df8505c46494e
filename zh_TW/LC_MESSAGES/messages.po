"<p> Mozillians are people who volunteer their time to advance the Mozilla "
"mission. They're dedicated to promoting openness, innovation and opportunity "
"on the Web and they form the core of our community. </p> <p> This directory "
"is a resource to make it easy for Mozillians to learn who is involved, what "
"they do and how to connect with them. </p> <p> Want to find Mozillians in "
"Auckland for a meetup? Need an expert XPCOM hacker to review a patch? That's "
"exactly what this site is for. </p> <h2>Privacy First</h2> <p> Privacy has "
"been an important part of this directory from the very beginning. We want to "
"make sure we provide Mozillians with the best experience possible, from the "
"way the site is built to the way we vouch for new users before they can "
"access data that should only be available to other Mozillians. Read our "
"Privacy Policy for more information. </p> <h2>Get Involved</h2> <p> The "
"community directory is also a community project and you are welcome to get "
"involved to help us make it even better or to integrate it into other "
"community tools. Get in touch with us on the Mozillians forums (link) to "
"learn how. </p>"
